# seckillproject(E-commerce Flash-sale Project, IMOOC)
The project is what I am learning from a learning website: IMOOC.

So far, I have accomplished the following parts:

-Set up the MVC frameworks;

-Implemented the visit to database by connecting Mybatis;

-Developed a backend user model including acquiring user information, defining common return object, implementing functions of OTP verification, registration and login;

-Developed frontend pages of OTP/registration/login that allow the cross-origin request using jQuery
